--> Ourvector Analysis:
    Created an app that matches the DNA from the file given by user and if there
    is a match, display the person's name from whoever the DNA matches too.
    A total of four ourvector vectors created through the structural of the
    program. Each of them associated and designed to do a specific task as
    required.
    1. ourvector <string> &fileDatabaseVec, this is a string vector accepts all of
    the data read through the file and stored in this vector, basically it stores
    all of the Database from the file given from user.
    2. ourvector <char> &fileDNAVec, this is a character vector that stores the DNA
    of the given user file, and displays whenever the command demands
    3. ourvector <char> titleVec, this is also a character vector that has only the
    title of any Database file given, the reason I have to create this vector is
    because the Database vector display should not display the title of the vector
    and basically I could not find the way to eliminate the title in DB vector
    4. ourvector <int> longestConsecutive, this is an integer vector that stores
    the longest consecutive STRs, and later use them for search milestone to
    detect the DNA matched person.
    -> All of the variables created in the program were needed to store some temporary
    or referenced variables that reflect back into whatever the function is passed.
    counting_STRs() is the function where I needed to keep track of so many things
    at once that forces me to create few variables, each variable's job is to hold
    some specific item/element so that I can use them in ahead of the program.

    -> The total number of vectors created for the member function _stats at the
    end of the app, # of vectors created:   5, this are the total number of vectors 
    created, includes DNA, DB, longestCons., title, and index vectors. 
    The # of elements inserted: 252, these are the total amount of each DNA, title,
    DB, etc elements are inserted in variety of different vectors. 
    The # of elements accessed: 2013, this number represents the number of times 
    the program accessed the elements in-order to use or display them through the 
    procedure of the program.
    The vectors are created at the following lines:
    line 224, 296, 297, 298, 299.
